# Open space and IOTA model two day track.

Start with a disorganised room, preferably with chairs in a stack.  No tables.

## Requirements:-
An empty room.

Chairs not tables

Post-its

A wall/board to hang Post-its

Flipcharts or wallboards, for diagramming/notes, for each breakout group


## Opening circle
Form a circle with chairs.  No outliers.  As close as socially possible

Introduction to Why we are here.

Explain the following ideal conditions:-
 * real business issues, maybe emotive, but they matter.
 * Complexity is high, no one person can solve the issues
 * Diverse group of people/skills are required to make the solution work
 * Conflict, real or potential will happen - this means we care.
 * there is a sense of urgency to all this activity

Scrum wall, to place the post-it's

## Guiding principles
Listen twice talk once

Be inclusive.  Allow/encourage everyone to speak. Everyone.

If one person is dominant, ask that person to allow others to speak.

Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.

Whoever comes to the meeting, are the right people

when it is done, it is done.

Law of two feet


## Process
Each person who wants to put up a topic will do so onto the wall, but first...

Each person will stand in the circle and read out their topic

Topics will then be grouped into similar groupings ( affinitiy grouping )

Dot voting - Each person gets 5 votes on what is the most popular topics

Choose most popular topics for 3 tracks, 3 sessions per track ( adjust for audience size )

Spend 40 minutes per topic.   

## Space facilitator tasks:-
Identify a facilitator and a notetaker for each session

Capture notes during the session according to the note template

Initalise the space with a Re-statement of the purpose/topic.

Observe the Participants and encourage participation from everyone, taking care to ask dominant people to allow
others to speak

## Outcomes
whatever is important to the group will rise to the top.

Issues discussed will be addressed by the people, most able to get them done.

All discussions will be documented

Priorities based on the discussions will be assigned on day 2

Action plans will be battle hardened in the Crucible.

## Closing circle
One sentence on what you learned today.


# Organiser's notes

# Suggested note taking in a group/room

# <Replace me with a proper title>

## Convener

Originator of the topic plus notetaker ( may be same person )

## Participants

emails, twitter handles, names all are OK.  Can be added at the end.

## Summary of Discussions

brief highlights of what was being discussed.  Notes should be taken throughout the proceedings for edit later.

## What will we do now?  What needs to happen next?
